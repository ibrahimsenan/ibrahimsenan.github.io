These stored key related issues and finding a solution for decreasing cryptographic
operations, in this dissertation, we proposing a system with a solution for managing users’ crypto
keys and control access to the resources in an application called CareBud. In this solutions, the
required security mechanisms or policies are applied in the client-side to protect the sensitive
data from malicious administrators or hackers before transmitting or storing it in any third-party
cloud computing services. Also finding a solution for the data that extended after encryption
which will consume a lot of storage units and processing time, which leads to a massive load on
the organization network.
